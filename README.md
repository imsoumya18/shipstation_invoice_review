An automation script to automate browser that will review invoices from given excel sheet

Steps:
1. Keep the file you want to modify in the same folder as the main.py is in.
2. When login page opens inautomated browser login by entering username and password and solve the captcha.
3. Captcha may not appear in some cases. You have to rerun the script again as it detects bot and refuses to allow it accessing the website.
